# Bug Fix Task

You are tasked with investigating and fixing a bug in repository: **{repository}**

## Context
- **Repository**: {repository}
- **Workspace**: {workspace}
- **Priority**: {priority}
- **Timestamp**: {timestamp}

## Objective
Systematically investigate, diagnose, and fix the reported bug:

1. **Bug Investigation**
   - Reproduce the bug consistently
   - Analyze error logs and stack traces
   - Identify the root cause of the issue
   - Understand the scope and impact

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Determine which components are affected
   - Assess potential side effects of the fix
   - Identify any related or similar issues
   - Evaluate urgency and risk level

3. **Solution Design**
   - Design a targeted fix that addresses the root cause
   - Consider multiple solution approaches
   - Plan for minimal disruption to existing functionality
   - Ensure the fix is maintainable and robust

4. **Implementation**
   - Implement the fix with clean, focused code changes
   - Add defensive programming where appropriate
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create tests that reproduce the original bug
   - Verify the fix resolves the issue completely
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Perform regression testing on related functionality

## Bug Fix Guidelines
- **Root Cause Focus**: Fix the underlying cause, not just symptoms
- **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest change that fully resolves the issue
- **Defensive Programming**: Add safeguards to prevent similar issues
- **Documentation**: Document the bug and fix for future reference

## Deliverables
- Complete bug fix with targeted code changes
- Test cases that verify the fix and prevent regression
- Updated documentation explaining the issue and resolution
- Post-fix validation report

## Additional Instructions
{custom_message}

Ensure the fix is thorough, well-tested, and doesn't introduce new issues or regressions.
