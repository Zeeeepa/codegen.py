## Instructions

You are tasked with generating comprehensive tests for the codebase. Please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Test Strategy Planning
- Analyze existing test coverage and identify gaps
- Determine appropriate testing levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Plan test organization and structure
- Choose appropriate testing frameworks and tools
- Define testing standards and conventions

### 2. Unit Test Generation
- Create unit tests for individual functions and methods
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Include boundary value testing
- Test error conditions and exception handling
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for high code coverage while focusing on meaningful tests

### 3. Integration Test Development
- Test component interactions and interfaces
- Verify data flow between modules
- Test API endpoints and database operations
- Validate external service integrations
- Test configuration and environment variations

### 4. Test Data Management
- Create realistic test data sets
- Implement test data factories or builders
- Ensure test data isolation and cleanup
- Handle sensitive data appropriately in tests
- Create reusable test fixtures

### 5. Test Quality Standards
- Write clear, readable, and maintainable tests
- Use descriptive test names and documentation
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
- Make tests fast and independent

### 6. Error and Edge Case Testing
- Test invalid inputs and boundary conditions
- Verify proper error handling and messages
- Test timeout and failure scenarios
- Validate security constraints and access controls
- Test performance under various conditions

### 7. Test Automation
- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
- Set up test reporting and coverage metrics
- Configure test environments and dependencies
- Implement test parallelization where beneficial
- Set up automated test execution triggers

### 8. Documentation and Maintenance
- Document test setup and execution procedures
- Create guidelines for writing new tests
- Document test data requirements and setup
- Provide troubleshooting guides for test failures
- Plan for ongoing test maintenance

### 9. Deliverables
- Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- Test documentation and setup instructions
- CI/CD integration configuration
- Test data management solution
- Performance and quality metrics

Please generate thorough, high-quality tests that ensure code reliability and maintainability.
