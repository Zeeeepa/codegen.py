# Codebase Analysis Task

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive analysis of the repository: **{repository}**

## Context
- **Repository**: {repository}
- **Workspace**: {workspace}
- **Priority**: {priority}
- **Timestamp**: {timestamp}

## Objective
Conduct a thorough analysis of the codebase to understand its structure, quality, and areas for improvement:

1. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Map out the overall system architecture
   - Identify key components and their relationships
   - Analyze data flow and dependencies
   - Document architectural patterns and design decisions

2. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate code complexity and maintainability
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Assess adherence to coding standards
   - Analyze test coverage and quality

3. **Technical Debt Evaluation**
   - Identify areas of technical debt
   - Assess impact and priority of debt items
   - Estimate effort required for remediation
   - Recommend debt reduction strategies

4. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
   - Analyze resource usage patterns
   - Evaluate scalability considerations
   - Suggest optimization opportunities

5. **Security Assessment**
   - Review security practices and vulnerabilities
   - Analyze authentication and authorization
   - Check for common security issues
   - Recommend security improvements

## Analysis Areas
- **Structure**: Module organization, separation of concerns
- **Dependencies**: External libraries, coupling analysis
- **Documentation**: Code comments, README, API docs
- **Testing**: Test coverage, test quality, testing strategy
- **Maintainability**: Code complexity, readability, modularity
- **Performance**: Efficiency, scalability, resource usage
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, best practices compliance

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive codebase analysis report
- Architecture diagrams and documentation
- Technical debt inventory with priorities
- Recommendations for improvements
- Action plan for addressing identified issues

## Additional Instructions
{custom_message}

Provide actionable insights and specific recommendations that can guide future development decisions.
