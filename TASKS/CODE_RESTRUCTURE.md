# Code Restructuring Task

You are tasked with restructuring and refactoring the codebase in repository: **{repository}**

## Context
- **Repository**: {repository}
- **Workspace**: {workspace}
- **Priority**: {priority}
- **Timestamp**: {timestamp}

## Objective
Improve the codebase structure, maintainability, and code quality through systematic refactoring:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Analyze current code structure and architecture
   - Identify code smells, anti-patterns, and technical debt
   - Assess code complexity and maintainability metrics

2. **Restructuring Plan**
   - Propose improved architecture and organization
   - Identify modules/components that need refactoring
   - Plan migration strategy to minimize disruption

3. **Implementation**
   - Refactor code following best practices
   - Improve naming conventions and code clarity
   - Extract reusable components and utilities
   - Optimize performance where applicable

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
   - Add or update tests as needed
   - Update documentation to reflect changes
   - Verify no regressions are introduced

## Focus Areas
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure each module has a single responsibility
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply object-oriented design principles
- **Clean Code**: Improve readability and maintainability
- **Performance**: Optimize where beneficial without sacrificing clarity

## Deliverables
- Refactored codebase with improved structure
- Updated tests and documentation
- Migration guide for any breaking changes
- Performance comparison (if applicable)

## Additional Instructions
{custom_message}

Prioritize maintainability and readability over premature optimization. Ensure all changes are well-tested and documented.
