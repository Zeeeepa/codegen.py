## Instructions

You are tasked with restructuring and reorganizing the codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and overall code quality. Please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Code Analysis
- Analyze the current codebase structure
- Identify redundant, duplicate, or poorly organized code
- Look for files that are randomly placed or don't follow logical organization
- Identify missing abstractions or proper separation of concerns

### 2. Restructuring Goals
- Create a logical, hierarchical folder structure
- Consolidate related functionality into appropriate modules
- Remove redundant code and eliminate duplication
- Improve naming conventions for files, classes, and functions
- Establish clear separation between different concerns (UI, business logic, data access, etc.)

### 3. Best Practices
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Ensure proper dependency management
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Update import statements and references after moving files
- Add proper documentation for the new structure

### 4. Deliverables
- Restructured codebase with logical organization
- Updated documentation explaining the new structure
- Migration guide if breaking changes are introduced
- Updated build/deployment scripts if necessary

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Ensure all tests still pass after restructuring
- Verify that the application still functions correctly
- Check that all imports and dependencies are properly updated
- Validate that the new structure improves code maintainability

Please provide a comprehensive restructuring plan and implement the changes systematically.
