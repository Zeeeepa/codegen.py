# Agent Management Interface - Interaction Patterns

This document outlines the key interaction patterns used throughout the Agent Management Interface, ensuring consistency and usability across different sections of the application.

## Navigation Patterns

### Global Navigation
- The sidebar provides access to all main sections of the application
- Current section is highlighted with a visual indicator
- Collapsible on smaller screens with a hamburger menu toggle
- Includes visual icons alongside text labels for better recognition

### Breadcrumb Navigation
- Displayed at the top of content areas to show the current location
- Clickable path segments for easy navigation up the hierarchy
- Example: Dashboard > Agent Runs > Run #123 > Logs

### Tab Navigation
- Used for switching between related content within a section
- Tabs are clearly labeled and highlight the active tab
- Consistent positioning at the top of content areas
- Responsive design: tabs become a dropdown menu on small screens

### Pagination
- Consistent controls for navigating through multi-page content
- Shows current page, total pages, and items per page
- Includes first/last page shortcuts for large datasets
- Allows customizing the number of items per page

## Data Interaction Patterns

### Filtering
- Consistent filter controls across all data views
- Quick filters for common scenarios (e.g., status, date ranges)
- Advanced filtering with multiple criteria and logical operators
- Filter state is preserved when navigating away and back
- Filter presets can be saved for reuse

### Sorting
- Click column headers to sort tables
- Visual indicators show sort direction (ascending/descending)
- Multi-column sorting available in advanced views
- Default sort order is defined for each view (typically by recency)

### Selection
- Checkbox selection for performing actions on multiple items
- Clear visual indication of selected items
- Batch actions appear when items are selected
- "Select all" and "Clear selection" options

### Search
- Global search in the header for finding any resource
- Contextual search within specific views
- Type-ahead suggestions as the user types
- Search history for quick access to previous searches
- Advanced search syntax for power users

## Form Interaction Patterns

### Input Validation
- Real-time validation as users type
- Clear error messages adjacent to the relevant field
- Visual indicators for valid/invalid input
- Form-level validation before submission

### Progressive Disclosure
- Complex forms use progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load
- Advanced options are initially hidden but expandable
- Multi-step forms with clear progress indicators
- Contextual help available for complex inputs

### Autosave
- Forms with multiple fields autosave as users work
- Clear indication when changes are saved
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Warning when navigating away from unsaved changes

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order follows a logical flow through forms
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Enter key submits forms when appropriate

## Feedback Patterns

### Loading States
- Consistent loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- Skeleton screens for content that's loading
- Progress indicators for operations with known duration
- Background loading for non-blocking operations

### Success Feedback
- Clear success messages for completed actions
- Temporary toast notifications for non-critical confirmations
- Animated transitions to indicate state changes
- Success states include next steps when appropriate

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Contextual placement of error messages near the source
- System-wide error handling for unexpected failures
- Retry options for transient errors
- Contact support option for persistent issues

### Empty States
- Informative empty states when no data is available
- Guidance on how to add data or take action
- Visual illustrations to make empty states engaging
- Call-to-action buttons to help users get started

## Responsive Interaction Patterns

### Touch Optimization
- Touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels for mobile users
- Swipe gestures for common actions on mobile
- Context menus adapt to touch interfaces
- Reduced hover-dependent interactions for mobile

### Viewport Adaptation
- Content reflows rather than requiring horizontal scrolling
- Critical actions remain accessible on all screen sizes
- Tables adapt to smaller screens by stacking or allowing horizontal scroll
- Font sizes adjust for readability on different devices

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of content as the user scrolls
- Pagination to limit initial data load
- Image optimization for faster loading
- Offline capabilities for critical functions

## Accessibility Patterns

### Keyboard Accessibility
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus order follows a logical sequence
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure for screen reader navigation
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Alternative text for images and icons
- Announcements for dynamic content changes

### Color and Contrast
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
- Sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
- Visual indicators beyond color for status and state
- High contrast mode available

### Motion and Animation
- Reduced motion option for users with vestibular disorders
- Essential animations are subtle and purposeful
- No flashing content that could trigger seizures
- Animations can be paused or disabled
