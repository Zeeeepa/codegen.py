# Codegen Agent API UI Implementation Plan

Based on the revised requirements and API endpoint analysis, here's a streamlined implementation plan for the Codegen Agent API UI.

## 1. Core Architecture (3 days)

### Phase 1: Backend Client Implementation (1.5 days)
- Create a unified backend client that interfaces with all Codegen API endpoints
- Implement proper authentication and error handling
- Add support for local storage of starred runs and projects
- Create models for all data types (agent runs, projects, etc.)
- Implement WebSocket or polling mechanisms for real-time log streaming

### Phase 2: UI Framework Setup (1.5 days)
- Set up the Tkinter UI framework with proper styling
- Implement the main application layout with header, navigation sidebar, and content area
- Create the event system for communication between components
- Implement state management for application data
- Set up the controller to coordinate between UI and backend

## 2. Agent Runs Tab Implementation (4 days)

### Phase 1: Agent Runs List View (2 days)
- Create the agent runs list view with filtering and search
- Implement the agent run card component with detailed status indicators
- Add starring functionality for agent runs
- Implement pagination for large lists of runs
- Add real-time status updates via WebSocket or polling
- Display time in hours and minutes only (no dates unless specifically requested)

### Phase 2: Agent Run Detail View with Live Streaming (2 days)
- Create the agent run detail view with tabs for details, logs, and output
- Implement log streaming with real-time updates showing:
  - Each ACTION with tool name, input, and output
  - Agent's thought process for each step
  - Error messages and warnings
  - Plan evaluations and final answers
- Add visual indicators for different log types (ACTION, PLAN_EVALUATION, ERROR, etc.)
- Add controls for resuming and stopping agent runs
- Implement log filtering by type (ACTION, ERROR, etc.)
- Add starring functionality from the detail view

## 3. Projects Tab Implementation (3 days)

### Phase 1: Projects List View (1.5 days)
- Create the projects list view with filtering and search
- Implement the project card component with setup command indicators
- Add starring functionality for projects
- Implement pagination for large lists of projects

### Phase 2: Project Detail View (1.5 days)
- Create the project detail view with tabs for details, setup commands, and agent runs
- Implement setup command generation functionality
- Add controls for creating new agent runs for the project
- Display associated agent runs with detailed status indicators
- Add starring functionality from the detail view

## 4. Starred Dashboard Implementation (3 days)

### Phase 1: Starred Runs View (1.5 days)
- Create the starred runs view with filtering and search
- Implement the starred run card component with detailed status indicators
- Add controls for managing starred runs (unstar, resume, stop)
- Implement project assignment functionality for starred runs
- Add real-time status updates for starred runs

### Phase 2: Starred Projects View (1.5 days)
- Create the starred projects view with filtering and search
- Implement the starred project card component with associated runs
- Add controls for managing starred projects (unstar, create run)
- Display associated agent runs with detailed status indicators
- Add real-time status updates for associated runs

## 5. Header and Active Runs Implementation (2 days)

### Phase 1: Active Runs Display (1 day)
- Create the active runs display in the header
- Implement real-time status updates for active runs
- Add quick access to run details and controls
- Display detailed status information for each active run

### Phase 2: User and Settings Menu (1 day)
- Implement user profile and settings menu
- Add organization selection functionality
- Implement application settings
- Add notification preferences for run completion/failure

## 6. Integration and Testing (2 days)

### Phase 1: Component Integration (1 day)
- Integrate all components into the main application
- Implement navigation between views
- Ensure proper state management across the application
- Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms

### Phase 2: End-to-End Testing (1 day)
- Test all functionality with real API endpoints
- Verify real-time updates and log streaming
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Optimize performance for large datasets

## Total Implementation Time: 17 days (3.5 weeks)

### Key Features Prioritized:
1. Real-time streaming of agent run logs with detailed status information
2. Comprehensive display of all log types (ACTION, PLAN_EVALUATION, ERROR, etc.)
3. Visual indicators for different log types and tool usage
4. Quick access to active runs from the header
5. Starring functionality for runs and projects
6. Project setup command generation and management

### Implementation Approach:
- Focus on core functionality first (agent runs, projects, starring)
- Implement real-time updates and log streaming as a priority
- Use a modular approach to allow for easy extension and maintenance
- Prioritize user experience and performance
