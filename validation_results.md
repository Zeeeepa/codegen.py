# Codegen API Endpoints Validation Results

This document summarizes the validation results for the 9 Codegen API endpoints using real credentials.

## Credentials Used
- **API Token**: sk-ce027fa7-3c8d-4beb-8c86-ed8ae982ac99
- **Organization ID**: 323
- **Orchestrator ID**: 72110

## Validation Results

### Users Endpoints

1. **GET /users - Get Users**
   - **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Successfully retrieved 1 user
   - **Response**: Contains user ID, email, GitHub username, and avatar URL

2. **GET /user/{id} - Get User**
   - **Status**: ❌ FAILED
   - **Error**: "Not found"
   - **Note**: This endpoint may not be implemented or accessible with the current credentials

3. **GET /user/current - Get Current User Info**
   - **Status**: ❌ FAILED
   - **Error**: "Not found"
   - **Note**: This endpoint may not be implemented or accessible with the current credentials

### Agents Endpoints

4. **POST /agent/run - Create Agent Run**
   - **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Successfully created agent run with ID 72160
   - **Response**: Contains agent run ID, status, creation time, web URL, and metadata

5. **GET /agent/run/{id} - Get Agent Run**
   - **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Successfully retrieved agent run details
   - **Response**: Contains agent run ID, status, creation time, web URL, and metadata

6. **GET /agent/runs - List Agent Runs**
   - **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Successfully retrieved 5 agent runs
   - **Response**: Contains paginated list of agent runs with details

7. **POST /agent/run/{id}/resume - Resume Agent Run**
   - **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Only works for agent runs with status "COMPLETE"
   - **Note**: If the agent run is still "ACTIVE", this will fail with a "Not found" error
   - **Implementation**: Added validation to check status before attempting to resume

### Organizations Endpoints

8. **GET /organizations - Get Organizations**
   - **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Successfully retrieved organizations
   - **Response**: Contains organization ID, name, and settings
   - **Note**: The API response doesn't match our model exactly, so we return raw data

### Agents-Alpha Endpoints

9. **GET /agent/run/{id}/logs - Get Agent Run Logs**
   - **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - **Details**: Tested multiple endpoint URLs:
     - `/v1/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/{agent_run_id}/logs`
     - `/v1/alpha/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/{agent_run_id}/logs`
   - **Implementation**: The client tries both endpoints and returns the first successful response

### Orchestrator Tracking

- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Details**: Successfully created child run with ID 72161 for orchestrator 72110
- **Response**: Child run status is ACTIVE
- **Note**: This demonstrates the ability to create hierarchical agent runs

## Summary

- **Successful Endpoints**: 5/9 (55.6%)
  - GET /users
  - POST /agent/run
  - GET /agent/run/{id}
  - GET /agent/runs
  - GET /organizations

- **Partially Successful Endpoints**: 2/9 (22.2%)
  - POST /agent/run/{id}/resume - Only works for "COMPLETE" status
  - GET /agent/run/{id}/logs - Requires trying multiple endpoint URLs

- **Failed Endpoints**: 2/9 (22.2%)
  - GET /user/{id}
  - GET /user/current

- **Orchestrator Tracking**: ✅ SUCCESS

## Implementation Details

1. **Resume Agent Run**:
   - Added validation to check if the agent run is in a resumable state (status must be "COMPLETE")
   - If the agent run is still "ACTIVE", the client will raise an exception with a clear error message
   - The CLI will display a helpful error message explaining that only completed agent runs can be resumed

2. **Agent Run Logs**:
   - Implemented a fallback mechanism that tries multiple endpoint URLs:
     - First tries: `/v1/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/{agent_run_id}/logs`
     - Then tries: `/v1/alpha/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/{agent_run_id}/logs`
   - Returns the first successful response
   - Added a new CLI command: `codegenapi logs --agent_run_id <id>` to retrieve logs

3. **Orchestrator Tracking**:
   - Successfully implemented and validated
   - Child runs can be created with a reference to their orchestrator
   - This enables complex workflows with hierarchical agent runs

## Recommendations

1. **API Client Adjustments**:
   - Modified the API client to handle the actual response formats
   - Added support for new status values: ACTIVE, COMPLETE, ERROR
   - Changed the organizations endpoint to return raw data since the API response doesn't match our model
   - Added validation for resume_agent_run to check status before attempting to resume
   - Implemented fallback mechanism for agent run logs endpoint

2. **CLI Implementation**:
   - Added a new `logs` command to retrieve agent run logs
   - Enhanced the `resume` command with validation to check if the agent run is in a resumable state
   - Added helpful error messages explaining the requirements for each command

3. **MCP Server Implementation**:
   - The MCP server should focus on the successful endpoints
   - For partially successful endpoints, implement the necessary validation and fallback mechanisms
   - For failed endpoints, provide graceful error handling
   - Implement orchestrator tracking functionality as it works correctly
